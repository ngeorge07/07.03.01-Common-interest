            Chess is played by two players on a chess board measuring
            eight-by-eight squares. The 64 squares alternate between light and
            dark colours - traditionally, black and white. When properly set up,
            a white square should be the rightmost square along the edge closest
            to each player. Players’ pieces are set up in the two horizontal
            rows (known as ranks) closest to each player. The second rank - ie.
            the second row from the player’s perspective - consists of a line of
            eight pawns, each placed on a single square. The closer rank is
            nearly symmetrical, with rooks (also known as castles) placed on the
            two leftmost and rightmost corner squares, followed by knights on
            the inside space next to them, then bishops. The two central squares
            of the rank are occupied by the king and queen. The queen is placed
            on the square matching her colour (for example, the black queen on
            the black square), with the king occupying the remaining square of
            the opposite colour. This means that the king and queen of each
            colour face each other, making the correct setup symmetrical between
            the two players. The white player takes the first move, with players
            alternating single turns until a player is defeated via checkmate or
            resigns. A draw can also be agreed. If playing with an optional
            timer, as in tournaments, the first player to run out of time
            forfeits the game.

          <h3>Algebraic notation (or AN)</h3>
          <p class="info_desc">
            Is the standard method for recording and describing the moves in a
            game of chess. It is based on a system of coordinates to uniquely
            identify each square on the chessboard. (On the picture above the
            white Queen are standing on d1)

          <p class="info_desc">
            In chess, each player takes turns to make a single move. Players
            cannot choose to skip a turn - they must move a piece. Each chess
            piece moves in a specific way, and must be moved according to its
            legal movement. Except for the knight, which may jump over pieces,
            pieces cannot move through pieces of either colour without either
            stopping (in the same of a piece of the same colour) or capturing
            them (in the case of a piece of the opposite colour).
          </p>
          <h3>Capturing pieces</h3>
          <p class="info_desc">
            If a piece lands on a space with an opponent’s piece, that piece is
            captured and removed from the board. Pieces cannot be placed on the
            same square as a piece of the same colour. When a piece captures an
            opponent’s piece, it must finish its current move action and end the
            player’s turn.

          <a id="Check and checkmate"></a>
          <h2 class="info_name">Check and checkmate:</h2>
          <p class="info_desc">
            When a piece moves in a way that would allow a player to capture the
            opponent’s king on their next turn, the attacking player typically
            announces “check”. The player placed into check must move their king
            or move another piece to stop the attack on their next turn - either
            by blocking the move or capturing the attacking piece. If a player
            creates a situation where their opponent cannot stop their king from
            being captured on the next turn, the attacking player announces
            “checkmate” and immediately wins the game. The king is never
            captured - a game of chess is won when a successful checkmate is
            announced. A player can also choose to resign, granting their
            opponent the victory. Matches can also end in an agreed draw - for
            example, as the result of stalemate leaving a player without any
            legal moves, or if no player can win using available legal moves, a
            situation known as a “dead position”. One example of a dead position
            is when both players are left with their king as their only
            remaining piece on the board. Draws can also occur as the result of
            advanced rules typically used in professional tournaments, including
            identical board positions occurring three or five times - rules
            known respectively as threefold repetition and fivefold repetition -
            or no captures or pawn moves taking place within the last 50 or 75
            moves. The exact rules used can depend on the tournament and
            agreement between the players.

          <h2 class="info_name">Advanced rules:</h2>
          <p class="info_desc">
            There are a number of advanced rules that can be used in chess,
            along with specific openings and board positions known by a variety
            of names, from the Double King's Pawn Opening to the famous King’s
            Gambit and Queen’s Gambit. Advanced rules can include specific
            variants that alter the core rules of the game, along with
            surrounding requirements often used in tournament settings, such as
            timing and the touch-move rule - which states that once a piece is
            touched by a player, it must make a legal move. As this is a
            beginner’s guide to learning chess, we’ll only be covering some of
            the essential advanced rules here - rules that should always be used
            in conjunction with the basic rules for moving and capturing pieces,
            as well as the standard setup and rules for declaring checkmate.
